			Welcome to <i>Man's Best Friend webpage.</i> Getting a dog is not a decision to be made lightly. It is important to do your research and 
			understand everything about the process. There are big dogs and little dogs, there are dogs who bark and quiet dogs, there are dogs
			who shed and dogs with little hair. There are dogs who require more exercise and there are dogs who can be easily trained. There are 
			certain dogs used for particular jobs and there are dogs who just want to be your friend. Before you decide on a dog think about what 
			you need and what fits best for your family.
